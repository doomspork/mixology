# Mixology

This is _not_ a library, it is a collection of tested Elixir examples solving various code challenges.

- [Palindrome](https://github.com/doomspork/mixology/blob/master/lib/palindrome.ex)

  Provided with a string ("aabbc") print all possible palindrome premutations ("abcba", "bacab").
  Leverages `ExUnit.CaptureIO` for tests.
